# synchronization-mechanisms-operating-systems
 In multi-threaded programs, shared resources must be accessed in a controlled  manner to avoid race conditions. This lab explores three synchronization mecha nisms:  Locks (Mutexes), Condition Variables: Allow threads to wait for a condition to become true, Semaphores: General synchronization primitives that can control access  to resources.
